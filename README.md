# Vox VT+ patches

## Introduction

This repository contains the code of a website inspired by the work of Olaf Posdzech and ODNewTrix which is available [here](https://engon.de/sounds/vox_valvetronix_patches.htm).

As explained by the author on the aforementioned website, custom sound settings (patches) shared by users on Voxamps.com were removed in 2013.
However, he succeeded in retrieving some files thanks to the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), and created a wonderful Excel macro file out of them.

As I did not own a copy of Excel, I was not able to use this macro file.
Hence, I created a web version of it so that Vox VT+ patches can be used on any platform.

The website corresponding to the code stored here is available at this link: https://aonnghus.github.io/VTplus-patches
